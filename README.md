# Coriander Vs Parsley

## Overview
This project aims to solve a common problem: distinguishing between coriander and parsley. Using deep learning and computer vision, we developed a classification model to accurately differentiate between the two. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training the model.

## Motivation
The idea for this project came from a real-life incident at home where the confusion between coriander and parsley caused culinary chaos. This led to the thought: "Why not solve this confusion with AI?" And so, this project was born.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of coriander and parsley. These images were collected and preprocessed into a training and test set.
### Dataset Details:
- **Number of Classes:** 2 (Coriander, Parsley)
- **Training Images:** 80% of total images
- **Testing Images:** 20% of total images
- **Image Size:** Resized to 224x224 pixels
